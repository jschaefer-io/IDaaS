# IDaaS
This projects aims to build an identity as a service (IDaaS) solution as a flexible microservice
meant for integrating authentication and authorisation into a distributed system. It implements
OAuth 2.0 and OIDC. All tokens are valid RFC-7519 JWTs and get signed asymmetrically using RSA-512,
allowing decentralized token validation.

This project is still in progress and not yet ready to be deployed.
